title=A distant town...
lots=The World Beyond
description=From the unberable heat of daylight to the freezing cold nights, the desolate wastelands of the World Beyond extend for as far as the eye can see. You spare a thought for the other colonists who are scavenging at this very moment, searching the ruins. You pause to think about the suffering of those who will never return. <LINE> <LINE> Will you decide to move forward and scavenge the World Beyond or to hide behind the great doors ?
